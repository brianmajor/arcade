# """This script splits out different observations in a single measurement set based on

## This is now a 2-part script.  This is part 2, which runs the splitting, and must be run
## in the same version of CASA as was originally used for the calibration in scriptForPI.py
## Part 1 generates the necessary lists of components to be split out, and relies on 
## msmd tools which are only available in more recent versions of CASA.

# If we need to include files that instead end in .ms, they might have the calibrated info 
# stored in the 'corrected' column instead.  This subtlety is used for the 'split' command

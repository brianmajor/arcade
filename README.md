## Overview
ARCADE is a general purpose online platform built to support ALMA data processing requirements. The system is currently in beta deployment with a limited number of simultaneous users.

The ARCADE system is also fully integrated with [CARTA: The Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy](https://cartavis.github.io/).

## Getting started
Obtaining an ARCADE user allocation requires a [CADC account](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html). Allocations are provided on a case-by-case basis while the system is in beta.

Sessions are started (or resumed) using the `ARCADE` and `CARTA` buttons on the [demo CANFAR homepage](https://demo.canfar.net/en/). Ensure you are logged in to your CADC account at the top right of the page to enable these options.

## Tutorials

There are also a series of [how to guides](arcade-tutorial) for ARCADE.

## Publication acknowledgement
Publications that made use of ARCADE platform must include the following statement in the acknowledgement:
*â€œWe acknowledge the use of the ARCADE (ALMA Reduction in the CANFAR Data Environment) science platform. ARCADE is a ALMA Cycle 7 development study with support from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the North American ALMA Science Centre, and the National Research Centre of Canada."*
